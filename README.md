[OpenGlassBox](https://github.com/Lecrapouille/OpenGlassBox) is a personal implementation from the slides of Maxis SimCity 2013 simulation engine named GlassBox and shown in at this [GDC conference](http://www.andrewwillmott.com/talks/inside-glassbox). Note this project is neither Maxis's released code source nor a project affiliated with them. This project is simply a portage from C#/Unity to C++11/SDL of https://github.com/federicodangelo/MultiAgentSimulation.
This current project is a sandbox: a preliminary work for its integration for another work-in-progress project of mine.

## Prerequisite

- Compilation tools: C++11 (g++ or clang++), Gnu Makefile and bc (basic calculator needed for my Makefile).
- Renderer: SDL2, SDL2_image (sudo apt-get install libsdl2-dev libsdl2-image-dev)
- GUI: [DearImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui), [imgui_sdl](https://github.com/Tyyppi77/imgui_sdl) (automatically downloaded but not installed).
- Debug: [backward-cpp](https://github.com/bombela/backward-cpp) (automatically downloaded but not installed if and only if you compile the project in debug mode).
- Non regression tests (optional and only for developers): [googletest](https://github.com/google/googletest), gcov.
- [MyMakefile](https://github.com/Lecrapouille/MyMakefile) used instead of CMake and installed when git cloning recursively.

## Download, compilation and run

- Download source:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/Lecrapouille/OpenGlassBox.git --recursive
```

- Compile the project:
```sh
cd OpenGlassBox/
make download-external-libs
make CXX=g++
```

- Run OpenGlassBox:
```sh
./build/OpenGlassBox
```

- (Optional) Unit test, code coverage:
```sh
cd OpenGlassBox/test
make coverage
```

## Notes concerning the portage

- Dependencies to the game engine Unity has been removed.
- Since I'm more interested by the simulation than the game renderer, I'm not using game engine but, for the moment, SDL2 which is enough to draw lines and dots. SDL2 may be replaced by OpenGL or by SFML in the futur.
- The original project did not come with unit tests or comments. Added !
- The original project was using the same names than the GDC conference. I renamed classes:
  - Box is now named City.
  - Point is now named Node.
  - Segment is now named Way.
  - ResourceBinCollection is simply named Resources (collection of Resource).
  - Unit to is now named ??? (to be defined).
  - SimulationDefinitionLoader is now renamed ScriptParser.
- The original project did not implement Area class (aka Zone). Area manages Units (creation, upgrade, destruction). This is also has to be added for this project. Currently an Unit shall be coupled to a Node of the Path. This is not particurlaly nice
since it creates lot of graph nodes.
- The original project implemented a dynamic A* algorithm in Path::FindNextPoint. I have created a Dijkstra class instead.
- Work in progress:
  - Update the dynamic A* algorithm to take into account of the traffic flow instead of shorter path. Make parallel the algorithm (dispatch over all CPU cores).
- Agent in the original code known by Node this can more difficult to compute flow. Should be better to be directly attached to Ways.
- Currently I made a quick & dirty script straightforward parser. I wish to replace it by Forth parser.
- Wish to show SimCity as a spreadsheet: insert/edit cells to add simulation rules.

## Screenshot

Note: the screenshot may not refer to the current developement state and also depends on smulation script.

For this particular screenshot:
- In pink: houses.
- In cyan: factories.
- In yellow: People going from houses to factories.
- In white: People going from factories to houses.
- In grey: path (nodes and ways).
- In blue: water (producted by factories).
- In green: grass (consumes water).
- Grid: city holding maps (grass, water), paths (ways, nodes) and units.

## How to play?

For the moment, you cannot construct you game interactively. A prebuild game is made in `main.cpp` inside `bool GlassBox::initSimulation()`.
You can type the `d` key for show a debug window showing intenral states.
