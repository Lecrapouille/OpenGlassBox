# OpenGlassBox

[OpenGlassBox](https://github.com/Lecrapouille/OpenGlassBox) is an open source implementation of the Maxis' SimCity 2013 simulation engine named GlassBox. Note: this project is not affiliated to Maxis Software but is a portage of
https://github.com/federicodangelo/MultiAgentSimulation from C#/Unity to C++11/SDL. The original
project was inspired by the [GDC presentation given by Maxis](http://www.andrewwillmott.com/talks/inside-glassbox).
This current project is a sandbox, a preliminary work for an integration in my project SimTaDyn.

## Axe of Developement

Done / wishes / work in progress:
- No dependency with the game enine Unity.
- Class coupling simplification from the initial code.
- Replacement of the home-made script by Forth script.
- SimCity spreadsheet: insert/edit cells to add simulation rules.

## Download, compilation and run

- Prerequisite: g++ or clang++, makefile, c++11, sdl2. Optional: bc, googletest.
